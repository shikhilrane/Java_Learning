        reference           value

    == is compare reference of the StringClass
    In 1st case : reference of both Strings are same because in StringClass constant pool both are refered at same memory
    In 2nd case : reference of the both literals are different in StringClass constant pool thats why it is also different.
    In 3nd case : reference of literal and object are different i.e. literal are stored in StringClass constant pool and objects are stored
                  in directly in heap memory
    In 4rd case : reference of both object refer to different memory location in heap memory

    In primitive data types, when we use == it checks the value, if values are same it shows true else false
    In non-primitive data types, when we use == it checks the references, if reference are same it shows true else false

    image attached check it
