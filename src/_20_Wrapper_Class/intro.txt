Wrapper Class - 
    1. A wrapper class in java is a class whose object wraps or contains primitive data types.
    2. When we create an object to a wrapper class, it contains a field, and in that field we can store primitive data types.
    3. We dont need to make Wrapper class explictly because it already present in JDK.
    4. The classes in java.util package handles only objects and hence wrapper classes helps in this class also
    5. Data structure in collection framework, such as ArrayList and Vector, store only objects(reference types) and not 
       primitive data types.
    6. It means in collection framework, ArrayList, LinkList, stack, map, queue, set does not support primitive data type so we 
       need to use object there in that case Wrapper class helps there.
    7. Wrapper class is present in java.util package
    8. An Object is need to support synchronization in multithreading
