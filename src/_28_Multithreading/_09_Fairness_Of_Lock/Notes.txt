Unfair Lock:
    Lock does not follow order of waiting threads (not FIFO).
    A thread that just became ready can jump ahead and get the lock first.
    Some threads might get the lock many times.
    Some threads might wait for a long time or never get the lock (called starvation).
    Default mode of Java’s ReentrantLock.
    Can lead to faster performance but less fairness.

Fair Lock:
    Lock follows strict first-come, first-served (FIFO) order.
    Threads acquire the lock in the order they requested it.
    No thread gets skipped or waits forever.
    Prevents starvation.
    Created by new ReentrantLock(true) in Java.
    Might be slightly slower due to overhead of managing queue order.
