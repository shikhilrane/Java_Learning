1. Java provides robust support to multithreading, allowing developers to create multiple tasks simultaneously, improving performance and responsiveness
2. In Java, multithreading is the concurrent execution of two or more threads to maximize the utilization of the CPU. Java's multithreading capabilities are part of the java.lang package, making it easy to implement concurrent execution.
3. In a single core environment, Java's multithreading is managed by JVM and OS, which switch betwenn threads to give the illusion of concurrency.
4. The threads shares the single core and time slicing is used to manage thread execution
5. In multicore environment, Java's multithreading can take full advantage of available cores. The JVM can distribute thread across multiple cores, allowing true parallel execution of threads
6. A thread is lightweight process, the smallest unit of processing. Java supports multithreading through its java.lang.Thread class and java.lang.Runnable interface.
7. When a Java program starts, one thread begins running immediately, which is called the main thread. This thread is responsible for executing the main method of program.
