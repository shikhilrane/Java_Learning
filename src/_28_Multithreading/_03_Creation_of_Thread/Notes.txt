To create a new thread in java, you can either 'extend the Thread Class' or 'implement the Runnable Interface'.

Thread class :
    1. Extend a class with Thread class
    2. Implement a run method
    3. Create an object of the class that implements Thread class in main method
    4. Then start the thread execution by calling start() method

Runnable Interface :
    1. Implement a class with Runnable Interface.
    2. Implement a run method
    3. Create an object of the class that implements Runnable Interface in the main method.
    4. Create an object of Thread class in the main method, and pass object of the class that implements Runnable Interface.
    5. Then start the thread execution by calling start() method
