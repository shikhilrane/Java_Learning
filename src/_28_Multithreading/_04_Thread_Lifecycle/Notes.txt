Thread Lifecycle :
    1. NEW : A thread is in this state when it is created but not yet started
    2. RUNNABLE: After the start method is called, the thread becomes runnable. It's ready to run and is waiting for CPU time.
    3. RUNNING : The thread is in his state when it is executing.
    4. BLOCKED/WAITING :  A thread is in this state when it is waiting for resource or for another thread to perform an action.
    5. TIME-WAITING : Thread state for a waiting thread with a specified waiting time. (Optional it happens if we use methods like Thread.sleep())
    5. TERMINATION : A thread is in this state when it has finished executing.

to see all the states of the Thread : click on .getState() then State then all these things are listed there

Running is not listed there because RUNNING state means program is in running state and it can't be printed during RUNNING
