Synchronization is the process of controlling access to shared resources in a multithreaded environment to prevent conflicts (like race conditions).

Example (3 Kids & 1 Notebook):

    Imagine 3 kids trying to write in 1 notebook at the same time.
        Kid1 starts writing
        Kid2 also grabs the pen and writes at the same time
        The writing gets messy or overwritten
        Problem: Shared resource (notebook) used by multiple kids at once → confusion (like in unsynchronized threads).

    With Synchronization:
        Only one kid at a time is allowed to write in the notebook.
        Others wait until their turn.
        Writing stays clean and correct.
        This is exactly what synchronized does in Java — it ensures one thread at a time can access the critical section (like the notebook).
