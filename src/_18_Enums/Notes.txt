Enum -
    0. Use when we have to use any specific properties multiple times, in that case we make separate enum class and store them there and fetch those values from there
    1. Enum means Enumeration.
    2. Enumeration means listing things like months in year, number of dept in college, number of days in week, etc.
    3. Enums are like class but using public static final keyword its easier to access them through Enum class
    4. Values we write in Enums are the instance of that Enum
    5. We can even make custom constructors in enum as it will get converted in to class during compilation
