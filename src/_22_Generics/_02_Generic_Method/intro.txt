Generic Methods -
    1. Similar to generic class, we can also create generic method that can be use with any data type of data. Such method is
       known as generic method
    2. Example - public <T> void genericMethod (T data) {...}
                 here, the tyoe parameter <T> is inserted after the modifier public and before the return type void.
    3. We can call generics methods by placing the actual type <String> and <Integer> inside the bracket before the method name.
        Example - demo.<String>genericMethod("Java Programming");
                  demo.<Integer>genericMethod(25);
    4. similar to generic class generic methods works, we dont have to state primitive data type for it, just state capital
       letter/s at place of data type.
    5. We can create generic static and generic non-static methods
    6. If we create non-static method then we have to create object for it as we do generally
    7. we can even pass class object in generic variable
    8. we can extend generic variable to Number class as well so it will only let us execute numbers (this is called bounded
       generics).
