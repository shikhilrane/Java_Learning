Que. :- How do arrays work?
Ans. :- if we have to store 3 students data then we make separate variable for each data
        but what if we want to store data of billions counts, in that case it will be very hectic to make variable for each and every data
        In that picture, arrays come into the picture we save n number of data within a single array
