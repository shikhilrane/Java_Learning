Polymorphism -
    1. Polymorphism allows us to perform single action in different ways.
    2. In other words, Polymorphism allows us to define one interface and have multiple implementation.
    3. The word 'poly' means many and 'morph' means forms, So it means many forms.
    4. There are two types of Polymorphysm : 
        1. Run-time Polymorphysm  -  (Method Overriding)
            Run-time Polymorphysm further gets divided in 3 different ways : 
                a. Normal Overriding - in which normal Overriding happens.
                    but when we have to access methods of parent data even child override parent's method then we use upcasting and downcasting
                b. Upcasting - in which, it will execute method (method in both classes are same) according to we pass value
                c. Downcasting - in which, method in both classes are different and to access method of child class we have to
                   downcast the object as we do in datatype casting.
        2. Compile-time Polymorphysm  -  (Method Overloading)
