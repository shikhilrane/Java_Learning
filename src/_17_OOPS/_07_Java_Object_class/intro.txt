Object class - 
    1. Object class upper most class. (Root of java classes)
    2. Object class is present in java.lang package.
    3. Every class is directly or indirectly derived from Object class.
    4. If class is not extended by any other class then it is direct child of Object class and if class is extended by any 
       other class then it is indirectly child of Object class.
    5. Therefore Object class methods are available in all over the classes
    6. Hence, Object class acts as root of the inheritance hierarchy in any java program.

    7. here A is a main class which has two child B and N, B has child C and N has child Method
    8. A is upper most class we have created
    9. & there is a Object class which is parent class of our upper most class (i.e. Object class is parent class of class A). 
   10. Object class is created by java developers and we get this class in JDK. We dont have to create Object class by our own. 
   11. All the methods Object class contains, is available for all the classes (either parent class or child class) in package.
       i.e. even classes B,N,C,M will get methods of Object class as class A getting it.
   12. Methods of Object Class - 
       1. getClass();   // it is a final method we can't override it. used to get to which class object belongs to (done)
       2. hashCode();   // this can be override (done)
       3. wait();       // we will not see this method
       4. toString();   // use to convert object reference to human readable form (done)
       5. clone();      // use to clone Obejct
       6. equals();     // use to check equality of object (done)
       7. finalize();   // It is used by garbage collector
       8. notify();     // use with thread so we will not see this method
       9. notifyall();  // use with thread so we will not see this
