1. OOPS stands for Object Oriented Programming System
2. The main purpose of OOPS is to deal with real world entity using programming language
3. In Procedural type of programming language, it was hard to solve real world problems that's why OOPS are introduced
4. Structure of Java is based on OOPS
5. Each and everything in Java is a member of class and interface (We will see the interface later)
6. Java doesn't let you write anything outside class
7. we will write everything inside class and interface.
8. features of OOPS : a. class          : it is a template where we only define logic
                      b. Object         : When we make an object for a class only then memory is defined for that class. It is an instance of class
                      c. Inheritance    : it allows a class to inherit the properties and methods of another class
                      d. Polymorphism   : same object or reference having different behavior
                      e. Encapsulation  : bundling Data and methods within a single unit, like a class, and controlling their access
                      f. Abstraction    : It is the process of hiding unnecessary information and only displaying what is needed to the user.
