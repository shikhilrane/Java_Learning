Lambda Expressions - 
    1. Lambda Expressions only works on Functional Interfaces
    2. As Functional Interfaces only has single methods thats why Lambda Expressions only works on Functional Interfaces
    3. Before implementing Lambda Expressions we must know thats we are using Functional Interfaces
    4. We can even make anonymous class of it but we have to write so many things in it, so it becomes tidious works
    5. So Lambda Expressions simplyfy that thing if Interface only have single method
    6. differece bettween anonymous Interface and Functional Interface is, anonymous Interface can have 1 or more methods in it 
       but Lambda Expressions must have only single method in it
    7. Syntax - 
        public class ClassName{
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                InterfaceName objectName = () -> {  // 4
                    ...code                         // 5
                }
                objectName.interfaceMethod()        // 6
            }
        }

        @FunctionalInterface            // 1
        interface InterfaceName{        // 2
            void interfaceMethod();     // 3
        }

        here, 1. Annotation
              2. Functional Interface
              3. Single Method
              4. Creation of object for subclass of FunctionalInterface, () means single method from FunctionalInterface,    
                 -> means Lambda Expression
              5. executable code
              6. method execution
