Abstraction 
    1. Abstraction is a keyword to make class abstract (means which is not defined).

    2. Abstract can be classes and methods.

    3. Though abstract classes can't be instantiated, we can make subclasses from it. we can then access members of abstract 
       class using the object of subclass.
       Example - 
       public class Abstraction{
            public static void main(String[]args){
                ChildOfAbstract c1 = new ChildOfAbstract();     // object of subclass
                c1.a = 3;
                c1.method1();
                c1.method2();
            }
       }
       abstract class AbstractClass{                            // Abstract class (Parent class)
            int a;
            abstract void method1();                
            abstract void method2();
       }
       class ChildOfAbstract extend AbstractClass{              // subclass of AbstractClass
            void method1(){
                // code
            }
            void method2(){
                // code
            }
       }

    4. If any abstract class any abstract method, then all child classes inherited from the abstract superclass must provide 
       the implementation of abstract method.

    5. Abstract class is non-executable (i.e., can't make an object of this class), it is just conceptual class, we just define 
       properties and methods in it and make subclasses of abstract class

    6. Subclass of abstract class is executable (i.e., can't make an object of this class).

    7. We have to add all the abstract methods from abstract class to its subclass otherwise it will give compile time error.

    8. We can't make abstract variable.

    9. We can't make abstract method as static because, as we know, static methods can even execute with or without making an 
       object but to execute abstract method we must need to make an object.

   10. If we make any method as abstract method, then we have to make whole class abstract

   11. We can make an object of subclasses to execute.

   12. all the variables in abstract class are 'public static final' by nature, so we can't update them in main method.

   13. all the methods in abstract class are 'public' to give access to its child class.

   14. concrete methods in abstract class are execute in object only if they called by object


   14.  class Animal {
            String name;
            abstract int legs();     // if we make any of the methods abstract, then we have to make whole class abstract
        }
