Class : 
    1. Class is a collection of Properties and methods
    2. It doesn't take any memory in memory as it doesn't exist physically. class is logical (i.e. heap or stack memory)
    3. Class is available in .java and in .class , java file => source code of class and .class file => byte code of class
    4. Class name can be started by capital letters
    5. There is only 1 public class in Java, which is associated with our java main class file name
    6. When function defined within class is called method & when function defined outside class is called function
    7. there are 2 types of java classes : ---------|----------------|
                                                    |                |
                                                    |                |
                                                pre-defined      user-defined
                                                  class             class
                                                1. Scanner        1. Dog
                                                2. Console        2. A
                                                3. System         3. Test
                                                4. String         4. Demo
                                                5. Math
                            pre-defined : class where java developers already wrote code for many class
                            user-defined : class which we made
    8. Syntax of class : 
        class ClassName {
            // Properties
            // methods
        }
    9. Classes doesn't get stored in heap and stack memory, metadata(i.e. properties and methods) of class stored in memory it & that memory is
       meta space memory

Object : 
    1. Object is an instance of a class that executes the class
    2. Once an object is created, it takes space in memory like other variable in memory
    3. We have to write object in main method
    4. Syntax of Object : 
        class_name object_name = new class_name();
        object_name.Property;
        method();
        OR
        class_name object_name;
        object_name = new class_name();
        object_name.Property;
        method();
        here , class_name = it is name of the class by which we are making a Object e.g. Car
               object_name = name of the object that we want to create e.g. BMW
               new = it specifies space in memory for the respective object. It allocated dynamic memory
               class_name() = constructor (Will see later)
               . = instance of operator (dot operator)
               so we can say that 'object_name' is instance of class 'class_name'
    5. In Java, we strictly need .class file to define object of class and as well as to call method of that class we need .class file.
    6. Objects got stored in heap memory
