Access modifiers
    1. It defines accessibility of class, method, field variable, etc. , everywhere where we want to control access
    2. There are 4 types of access modifiers in java , 1.Public 2.protected 3.private 4.default
    3. access modifiers or access specifiers, these are keywords that tells which data is accessible to whom, means which data and function can
       be use by part of code

    Access modifiers        within class        within package      outside package by subclass only        outside package
    1. Private                   Y                    N                             N                              N
    2. Default                   Y                    Y                             N                              N
    3. Protected                 Y                    Y                             Y                              N
    4. Public                    Y                    Y                             Y                              Y



    NOTE : This is just introduction to access modifiers, we will see complete access modifiers later in the chapter
           along with access modifiers we will also see getters and setters



   Understanding whole packaging :
      16OOPS > 04Encapsulation > 04AccessModifiers > AccessModifiers.java
      so in file it will be like,

      package 16OOPS.04Encapsulation.04AccessModifiers;

      public class AccessModifiers{

      }
   this is how we can have packaging

   Understanding importing package :
      package 16OOPS.04Encapsulation.04AccessModifiers;

      import java.16OOPS.15BitManupulation.*;

      public class AccessModifiers{

      }
