Method Overloading : 
    1. With the help of method overloading, two or more methods can have same name inside the same class if they accept different arguments or 
       different data types. It is known as method overloading
    2. Method Overloading is used when we have to make multiple number of functions with same name.
    3. Method Overloading is achieved by,
       a. by changing the number parameters :- if we pass 2 int type of parameters in function 1 then we have to pass different number of int type
                                               of parameters in rest of all function with who have same name. 
                                               e.g. 
                                               public static int numberParameter(int a, int b){
                                                        return a+b
                                               }
                                               public static int numberParameter(int a, int b, int c){
                                                        return a+b+c;
                                               }
                                               public static int numberParameter(int a, int b, int c, int d){
                                                        return a+b+c+d;
                                               }
                                               in first function we passed 2 int type of parameters & in second we passed 3 int types of parameters whereas, in third we passed 4 int type of parameters.
                                               we can use same name for multiple functions with same data type as parameters but with different
                                               numbers of same data type as paramters in every function that has same name.

       b. by changing the data type of parameters :- if we passed 2 int type of parameters in function 1 then we have to pass 2 float or byte or
                                                     etc. type of paramters in other functions with same of function 1
                                                     e.g. 
                                                     public static int dataTypeParameters(int a, int b){
                                                              return a+b;
                                                     }
                                                     public static float dataTypeParameters(float a, float b){
                                                              return a+b+c;
                                                     }
                                                     public static long dataTypeParameters(long a, long b){
                                                              return a+b+c+d;
                                                     }
                                                     here, in first function we passed 2 int type of parameters & in second function we passed 2
                                                     float type of paramters & in third function we passed 2 long type of data type.
                                                     so in this type of overloading, we can keep same number of data types for parameters but It
                                                     must have different type of data type for all the function paramters that has same fn name.
    4. It is not overloading if we only change return type of methods. Method overloading is not achieved by just changing return type. Method 
       Overloading depends on parameters only.
