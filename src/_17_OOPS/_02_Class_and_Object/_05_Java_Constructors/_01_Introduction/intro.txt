Constructors
    1. When you call an object of class, in that case Constructor is called with object
    2. class_name object_name = new class_name();
                                        ||
                                        ^
                                this is constructor
    3. Constructors are invoked implicitly when you instantiate objects (instance = object).
       initialization = it means an object is created, and you are initializing it with some value
       instantiate = it is a first step, means step of creation of object
    4. Two rules for creating constructors,
       a. name of constructor must be same as class name.
       b. Constructor must not have return type.
    5. When we don't make any constructor, then java makes default constructor and that default constructor has value 0.
    6. every object initialize through constructor value.
    7. If we make constructor in class and pass values to constructors in object, then object initialization will take place according to
       constructor values otherwise if we don't give values then java reckon constructor value as 0.
    8.
      public class Constructor {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            -------------->------------------>-------------->---|       // this is control flow of object. Every object invokes constructor
            Complex firstConstructor = new Complex("Hey",4,6);  |
            firstConstructor.print();--<---------------<-----<--|                        
            Complex secondConstructor = new Complex("Hello",8,9);
            secondConstructor.print();
        }
      }

      class Complex{
        String name;
        int a, b;
        public Complex(String constructorName, int num1, int num2){
            name = constructorName;
            a = num1;
            b = num2;
        }

        void print(){
            System.out.println(name + " " + a + " + " + b + "i");
        }
      }
    9. If we override constructor in class and don't pass value in object constructor, then it will show error.
    10. a constructor can't be abstract or static or final (should not use these keywords while creating constructor)
    11. Constructor can be overload but can't be override
            overload : it means we can create make as many as constructor with rules of method overloading
            override : we can't change the value of constructor parameter again and again in same class.
