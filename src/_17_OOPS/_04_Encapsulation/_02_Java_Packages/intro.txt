Java Packages : (Package creation)
    1. A Packages simply a container that groups related types (Java classes, Interfaces, enumerations(not imp) & annotations(not imp)).
    
    2. To define package in java, you use keyword 'package'.

    3. Java uses file system directories,
        Example : 
        |____com                // folder com
           |____test            // inner fodler of com
              |____Test.java    // inner file of com => test

        package com.test
        class Test{
             public static void main(String[]args){
                System.out.println("Hello World!");
             }
        }

    4. packages are not just folders these packages provide more than folders

    5. packages are made automatically in the IDE.

    6. It is used to group similar types of data

    7. packages are not important while learning dsa, because while doing DSA, we work on single file.

    8. whereas, in java development there are many folders so we have to manage many folders there with java packages

    9. to make java package we need to write at starting of file : 
       package folder1.folder2.folder3
       (NOTE : we should not have spaces between name of folders to vreate java package)

   10. this is how we can create package.

   11. Understanding whole packaging : 
        16OOPS > 04Encapsulation > 04AccessModifiers > AccessModifiers.java
        so in file it will be like,
   
        package 16OOPS.04Encapsulation.04AccessModifiers;
   
        public class AccessModifiers{
      
        }
        this is how we can have packaging
