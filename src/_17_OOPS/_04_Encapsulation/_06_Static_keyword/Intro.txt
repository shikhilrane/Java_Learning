Static keyword : 
    1. If we want to access class member without creating an object of the class, we need to declare class member as static.

    2. Static variables can be accessed by calling the name of the class.
       Example : class ClassName {
                    static int i = 10;
                 }
                 psvm{
                    System.out.println(ClassName.i) => o/p = 10
                 }

    3. There is no need to create object of the class for accessing static variables because static variables are class 
       variables and are shared amongst all the class objects.

    4. we can even update value of static variables in main method (Which is not recommended)
       Example : class ClassName {
                    static int i = 10;
                 }
                 psvm{
                    System.out.println(ClassName.i) => o/p = 10
                    ClassName.i = 15;
                    System.out.println(ClassName.i) => o/p = 15
                 }

    5. It is a class level variable, memory allocation of such variables happens once when the class is loaded in the memory.
       static variable executes at compile time while non static variable compiles at runtime. (flow of execution class load > function load > execution)

    6. If in main method, object updates value of static variable, change is reflected across all objects.(as we saw in pt 4)

    7. Static type of variable can be used in any type of method i.e. static or non-static. (because we know that static 
       methods executes with or without object so it can be execute in non-static method as well but if we put non-static variable in static method then it can't be possible)

    8. Non-static variables can't be use inside static method. it will throw complie time error

    9. If we think, method of which we dont need to make object for that method then we can use staic methods

   10. we can't use this and super keyword for static method or variable

   11. Static block runs at starting before main method. we can add in things in static block if we want to execute something at
       time of class loading

   11. it is not good practice to change value for static variable so we can use final keyword with static keyword.
       Example : class ClassName {
                    static final int i = 10;
                 }
                 psvm{
                    System.out.println(ClassName.i) => o/p = 10 
                    ClassName.i = 15;
                    System.out.println(ClassName.i) => o/p = 10
                 }
        we can't change value for i here
