Importing a package : 
    1. when we have to use package in some other package, to do that thing we need to import package.

    2. java has an import statement that allows you to import an entire package or only certain classes and interfaces defined in package.
        Example : 
            import java.util.Date;   // it will import only Date class
            import java.io.*;        // it will import everthing inside java.io packages (* is used to access all the classes inside package).

    3. in java, the import statement is written directly after the package statement (if it exist) and before the class defination.
       Example : 
         package package.Name;       // package
         import package.className;   // wrote import statement between package and class
         class MyClass{              // class
            // body             
         }

    04. Understanding whole packaging : 
            16OOPS > 04Encapsulation > 04AccessModifiers > AccessModifiers.java
            so in file it will be like,
   
            package 16OOPS.04Encapsulation.04AccessModifiers;
   
            public class AccessModifiers{
      
            }
            this is how we can have packaging

        Understanding importing package : 
            package 16OOPS.04Encapsulation.04AccessModifiers;

            import java.16OOPS.15BitManupulation.*;

            public class AccessModifiers{
      
            }
        we need to import things if classes are present in other package if classes are present in same package then there's no need to import
        NOTE : we have program for packages, importing package and access modifiers in packagess folder of root
