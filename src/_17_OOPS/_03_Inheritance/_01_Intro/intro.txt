Inheritance :
    1. Inheritance is one of the features of OOP that allows us to create a new class from an existing class.

    2. Inheritance means a class (parent class) can inherit its properties and methods to its subclass (child class of parent class).

    3. we can make as many as child classes from one parent class.

    4. The new class that is created is known as subclass (child or derived class).

    5. The existing class from where the child is derived is known as superclass (parent class or base class).

    6.                          |------------------|
                                |   parent class   |
                                |------------------|
                                          ^
                                          |
                                          |
                                |------------------|
                                |   child class    |
                                |------------------|
                                
    7. we have to state, extends parent_class name , in a class which we want to make subclass
                public class parent_class{
                    // properties
                    // methods
                }
                public class child_class extends parent_class{
                    public static void main(String[]args){
                        child_class object_name = new child_class();
                        object_name.properties;
                        object_name.methods();
                    }
                }
        here, child_class will inherit all the properties and methods of parent_class
