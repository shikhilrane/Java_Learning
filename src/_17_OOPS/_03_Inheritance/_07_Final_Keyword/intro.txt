final keyword 
    1. In java, the final keyword is a non-access modifier that is used to define entities can't be changed or modified.
    2. where ever we use final as variable, method or class then it will bacome unchangable.
    3. use case = 
       Final variable : variable with final keyword can't be assigned again. (use when we know that this const can't be changed e.g. Pi = 3.14)
       Final method   : method with final keyword can't be overridden by subclasses. (use when we dont want any subclass can't override method)
       Final class    : Class with final keyword can't be extended or inherited from other classes (Use when we dont want this class should not be any further subclass from particular class)
