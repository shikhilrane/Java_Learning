try catch-finally block
    1. In java, We can also use the finally block after the try...catch block.
    2. In this case, finally block will always executed whether there is an exception inside the try block or not.
    3. It is good practice to use finally block to include important cleanup like closing file or connection.
    4. We can use multiple catch block before finally block but we can use finally block only once.
    5. finally block is similar like default in switch cases and else in conditional statemwnts

    NOTE : There are some cases when a finally block does not execute : 
            1. Use of System.exit() method
            2. An exception occurs in the finally block
            3. The death of thread
