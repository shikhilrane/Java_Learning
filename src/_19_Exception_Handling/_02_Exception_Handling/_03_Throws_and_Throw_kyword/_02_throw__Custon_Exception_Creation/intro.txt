throw keyword - 
    1. The throw keyword is used to explicitly throw a single exception.
    2. This is also called Custom Exception.
    3. public static void divideByZero(){
            throw new ArithmeticException("Trying to divide by 0");
       }
    4. we have to create class to throw exception and extend our class with Exception class
    5. then create a constructor and pass String message as parameter
    6. use super keyword to show message in our custom exception, super(message) it is a standard statement in Exception class
    4. we can even throw inbuilt exception here
