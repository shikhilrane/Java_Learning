throws - 
    1. We use throws keyword in the method declaration to declare the type of exceptions that might occur within it.
    2. public static void fileName() throws IOException{
            // code that may produce IOException
            File newFile = new File("test.txt");
            FileInputStream stream = new FileInputStream(newFile);
       }
