Introduction to Servlets:
    1. Servlets are Java Program that run on a web server, handling client requests and generating dynamic responses.
    2. Servlets used to process or store data submitted by an HTML form, provide dynamic content like returning results from a database query, manage state information, etc.

Servlet Lifecycle : The servlet control by container (e.g. Tomcat) and it goes through the following Stages :
    1. Loading and Instantiation : The servlet class is loaded and its object is created.
    2. Initialization (init Method) : The init method is called once to initialize the servlet,
    3. Request Handling (service method) : The service method is called for each request to process it.
    4. Destruction (destroy method) : The destroy method is called once before the servlet is removed from service
