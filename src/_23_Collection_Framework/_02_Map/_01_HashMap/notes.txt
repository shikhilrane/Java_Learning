Internal Structure of HashMap :
    Key -> Identifier use to retrieve value.
    Value -> The data associated with key.
    Bucket -> It is a array in which key-value of hashmap is stored. (Initial size = 16)
    Hash function -> takes the key from bucket into index for storage. It is algorithm that takes an key and returns fixed size string of bytes, typically a numeric value. The output is known as hashcode or hash value or simply hash. It will always produce the same output for the same input. This is a fast algorithm.

How data is stored in HashMap :
    Step 1 -> Hashing the key
        The key is passed through hash fucntion so that unique hascode is generated. So according to hashcode, key value pair is stored in array (called bucket array).
    Step 2 -> Calculating the index
        The hash code is then used to calculate an index in the array(bucket location) using formula = int index = hashcode % arraySize.
        This index decides which bucket will hold this key-value pair.
        e.g. If the array size is 16, the key's hashcode will be divided by 16 and remainder will be the index
    Step 3 -> Storing in the bucket
        The key-value is stored in the bucket at the calculated index. Each bucket can hold multiple key-value pairs (This is called collision handling mechanism)

    Collision handling -> different keys can generate same hashcode so that it can be stored in same index of array and there collision handling happen.

    So, how multiple key-value stored at same it is because, every key-value stored as a linkedlist at an index.

    Rehashing = As we know capacity of ArrayList can be increase or decrease with the help of threshold, We can use same mechanism for Bucket as well. Initial threshold for bucket is 0.75

    e.g. =>
        HashMap<String, Integer> fruits = new HashMap<>();
        fruits.put("apple", 30);    Hashcode from hashfunction = 3544354    => saved at 4th index
        fruits.put("banana", 40);   Hashcode from hashfunction = 2154566    => saved at 7th index
        fruits.put("orange", 50);   Hashcode from hashfunction = 2154566    => saved at 7th index

        Bucket Array
        0   ->
        1   ->
        2   ->
        3   ->
        4   ->  "apple", 30
        5   ->
        6   ->
        7   ->  "banana", 40 -> "orange", 50    // This will be linkedlist
        8   ->
