Map :
    1. It doesn't extends Iterables
    2. In Java, a map is an object that maps keys to values. It can't contain duplicate keys, and each key can map to at most one value. Think of it is like a dictionary, where you look uo for word(key) to find its definition(value).
    3. Key-Characteristics of Map :
        Key-value pair : Each entry in a map consists of a key and a value.
        Unique Keys : No two entries can have same key.
        One value per key : Each key maps to single value.
        order : Some implemetation contains insertion order (LinkedHashMap), Natural Order(TreeMap), No Order(HashMap).
    4. Example :
        Id(key)         Name(value)
          1             A
          2             B
          3             C
          4             D
          5             B
          6             A
          7             D
          From above example, we can conclude that key must be unique whereas values can be repetitive.
