Collection FrameWork and Lists :
    Implementation of multiple types of Data Structure is given by Java. So we dont have to create them manually.

    Q.What is collection?
    ans. collection is a simply object that represent a group of objects

    Q.What is collection Framework?
    ans. In Collection Framework there are interfaces and classes to manage collections

    We can apply loops on collection interface as it implements Iterable interface

Java Collection Framework :
    Java Collection Framework provides a set of interfaces and classes to implement various data structures and algorithms.
    These include several methods to perform different operations on collections.
