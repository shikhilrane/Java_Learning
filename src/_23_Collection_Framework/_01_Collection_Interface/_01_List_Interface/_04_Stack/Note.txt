Stack -
    1. Stack is represented in vertical manner.

    2. It works on LIFO principle (i.e. Last In First Out)

    3. Stack extends vector class so it is thread safe as well.

                        |        4          |
                        |-------------------|
                        |                   |
                        |        3          |

                        |        2          |

                        |                   |
                        |        1          |

        Above one is Stack, in this 1 is added first then 2 then 3 then 4 but removing 4 will remove first then 3 then 2 then 1
        This behaviour is known as LIFO which happens in Stack

    It includes methods of Collection, Lists and Vector as well :
        1. push(E item) – Adds item to top of stack
        2. peek() – Returns top element without removing it
        3. pop() – Removes and returns the top element
        4. search(Object o) – Returns position (1-based) from top of stack
        5. empty() – Returns true if stack is empty
        6. size() – Returns total number of elements
        7. contains(Object o) – Checks if element is present
        8. Iterate Stack (LIFO Order)
