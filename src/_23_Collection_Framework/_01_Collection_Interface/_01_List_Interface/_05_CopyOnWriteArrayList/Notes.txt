🔹 What is CopyOnWriteArrayList?
    CopyOnWriteArrayList is a thread-safe version of ArrayList in Java.
    It's part of the java.util.concurrent package.
    It allows safe access from multiple threads without needing explicit synchronization.
    It’s best suited when you read more often and write (modify) less.

🔹 Why is it called “CopyOnWrite”?
    Because when you modify (add, remove, update) the list, it creates a copy of the array underneath.
    ✅ Read operations happen on the current array.
    ❗ Write operations (like add/remove/set) create a new copy of the array.
    This means:
    No ConcurrentModificationException during iteration.
    Safe to iterate even while other threads modify the list.
    But copying on every write makes it slow if you write frequently.

🔹 When should you use CopyOnWriteArrayList?
    ✅ Use when:
    You have multiple threads accessing a list.
    Most operations are read-only.
    You want to avoid ConcurrentModificationException.
    ❌ Don’t use when:
    There are frequent updates/writes — it becomes inefficient due to copying.

    Thread-safe?	                        ❌ No	                        ✅ Yes
    Allows concurrent access?	            ❌ Risky	                    ✅ Safe
    Fast for reading?	                    ✅ Yes	                        ✅ Yes
    Fast for writing?	                    ✅ Yes	                        ❌ Slower (copies on write)
    Fails during concurrent iteration?	    ✅ Yes (throws exception)	    ❌ No (safe iteration)

🔹 Real-Life Analogy
    Imagine a whiteboard in a classroom:
    Students are reading from it (like reading a list).
    When the teacher wants to make changes, instead of erasing the board, they bring a new board, make changes there, and then swap it in.
    This avoids disturbing students currently reading the old board.
    That’s how CopyOnWriteArrayList works — make a copy on write, leave readers undisturbed.


    1. removeIf(Predicate) – Removes elements that match condition
    2. replaceAll(UnaryOperator) – Replace each element using a function
    3. sort(Comparator) – Sorts the list in natural order
