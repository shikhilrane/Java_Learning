Understanding Collection Interface -
    1. Collection Interface is present in java.util package introduce in 1.2 version
    2. Syntax - public interface Collection<E> extends Iterables<E> {
                    // Code
                }
    3. Collection Interface has some methods that can be implemented by classes


The collection Interface includes various methods that can be used to preform different operations on objects.

Key features of List Interface: Order Preservation, Index-based access, allows duplicates.

Methods of Collection Interface :
    1. int size() - Returns the number of elements in collection.
    2. boolean isEmpty() : Returns true if the collection contains no elements.
    3. boolean contains(Object o) : Returns true if the collection contains the specified element
    4. boolean add (E e) : Add the specific element to the collection. Returns true if the collection changed as the result.
    5. boolean remove(Object o) : Removes a single instance of the specified element from the collection, if it is present.
    6. boolean containAll(Collection<> c) : Returns true if the collection contains all the elements of the specified collection.
    7. boolean addAll(Collection<> c) : Adds all elements from the specified collection to the collection.
    8. boolean removeAll(Collection<> c) : Removes all the elements in the collection that are also contains in specified collection.
    9. boolean retainAll(Collection<> c) : Removes all the elements from the collection that are not present in the specified collection.
    10. void clear() : Removes all elements from the collection.
    11. Object[] toArray() : Returns an array containing all the elements in the collection.


List and Set ->
    1. List -
        1. List is an index based data structure
        2. List can store duplicate objects
        3. List can store multiple numbers of null values
        4. List follows the insertion order because it adds elements by index
        5. We can iterate list element by iterator(we can get element in forward direction) and ListIterator(we can get element in forward and backward direction)

    2. Set -
        1. Set isn't an index based data structure, It stores the data according to hashcode values (unique integer values)
        2. Set doesn't allow us to store duplicate objects
        3. Set can store only one null value
        4. Set doesn't follows the insertion order because it adds elements by using hashcode
        5. We can iterate the set elements by iterator

Cursors ->
    there are total 3 cursors Iterator, ListIterator and Enumeration
    1. Iterator can be used with all like List, Set, and Queue. It can only iterate forward
    2. ListIterator can be only used with classes of List. It can iterate forward as well as backward
    3. Enumeration can be used with Legacy classes like Vector and stack. It can only iterate forward and can only use for read operations (hasMoreElements() and nextElement())
