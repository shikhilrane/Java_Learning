Stream is a feature introduced in Java 8.
With the help of Streams we can process collections of data in a functional and declarative manner
Before java streams, We have to use loops and conditionals that makes our code looks bigger that increases readability
Simplify Data Processing
Embrace functional Programming
Enable easy parallelism without dealing with multithreading's complexity

what is stream?
A sequence of elements supporting functional and declarative programming (conversion of collection into stream so that you can use functional and declarative on it)

How to use Stream?
it requires source, intermediate operation and terminal operation
e.g.
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1,2,3,4,5);
numbers.stream().filter(x -> x % 2 == 0).count()
here, numbers = source
      intermediate operation = filter(x -> x % 2 == 0)
      terminal operation = count()

Creating Stream ->
1 From Collections
List<Integer> list = Arrays.asList(1,2,3,4,5);
Stream<Integer> stream = list.stream();
2 from Arrays
String[] array = {"a", "b", "c"};
Stream<String> stream1 = Arrays.stream(array);
3 Using Stream.of()
Stream<String> stream2 = Stream.of("x", "y", "z");
4 Infinite Stream
Stream<Integer> stream3 = Stream.generate(() -> 1).limit(10); //all the stream will have 1 in it if we add limit then only 10 streams (we will this see later)
     2nd way of creating infinite stream
Stream.iterate(1, x -> x + 1);
     seed = initial position, integer = operation on next
     1, x -> x + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2
     2, x -> x + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3 and so on...
